Before working with Auntie Porridge, Jackie, a grain aggregator, used to scrape by selling small sacks of rice, earning around UGX 100,000 ($26) a month.

When Angella’s company became a steady buyer, Jackie’s business transformed. She now sells one to two tons at a time, boosting her income by 600% and investing in her family’s future.

This was possible thanks to Inua Capital and the Mastercard Foundation Africa Growth Fund helping Auntie Porridge scale, linking them to formal markets and transforming lives far beyond Kampala.

Stories like Jackie’s show why investing in African businesses, led by Africans, is about more than growth. It’s about building dignity and resilience from the village up.

Are you a Kenyan-led organization experienced in leading innovative youth-centric programming?
 
The Mastercard Foundation is seeking a youth enabling organization who will collaborate closely with the Youth Engagement team to manage youth-led organizations (YLOs) in Kenya. Through our Young Africa Works strategy, we aim to enable 7 million young people, 70% being young women, to secure fulfilling work by 2030. A core part of this strategy is the Foundation’s deep commitment to partnering with YLOs, recognizing their vital role in reaching and empowering Kenya’s most marginalized young women and men.
 
YLOs bring firsthand insight into the challenges faced by young people and are critical in designing and delivering relevant, inclusive, and impactful solutions. ﻿﻿This assignment will revolve around YLOs’ mapping and recruitment, onboarding, contracting, MEL, and overall program management.

It’s a mindset. A way of seeing. A way of working.”

In a keynote speech at the Inclusive Africa Conference 2025, Dina randrianasolo, Director Strategic Partnerships & Innovation  Mastercard Foundation set the tone for urgent, actionable inclusion. She called on everyone governments, innovators, entrepreneurs, and communities to stop treating accessibility as an afterthought and start recognizing it as the foundation for progress.

From announcing 92,000+ youth with disabilities supported through Young Africa Works to spotlighting entrepreneurs like Julius Mbura and Faith, Dina reminded us that access to Assistive Technology is access to possibility.
Only 3% of the 135 million Africans who need AT have it. But when youth with disabilities are equipped, they don’t just thrive they lead, create, and shift systems.

Her call to action was clear: don’t just open doors, hold them open. Share power. Scale solutions. And build an Africa where exclusion is no longer an option.

By listening to young people’s perspectives, the research aims to offer valuable actionable insights into effective and responsive programs, policies, and practices for enabling access to dignified and fulfilling work. The new research will delve deeper into the factors that enhance youth resilience, emphasizing their lived experiences, voices, and agency, as well as their perceptions of sustainability and systems change. The program will be implemented across ten countries, namely, 𝗞𝗲𝗻𝘆𝗮, 𝗨𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮, 𝗥𝘄𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮, 𝗘𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗮, 𝗚𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗮, 𝗡𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮, 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗮𝗹, 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻, 𝗧𝗼𝗴𝗼, and 𝗖𝗼𝘁𝗲 𝗱'𝗜𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗿𝗲.

We are deeply grateful to the Mastercard Foundation for their renewed commitment to partnering with #PASGR in centering this research on young people, especially young women across Africa, to access dignified and fulfilling work and to contribute to lasting systems change across the continent.

Educating girls and young women is essential for the economic future of the African continent. During our #Invincible event on the sidelines of #UNGA79, Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director UNAIDS and an Under-Secretary General of the United Nations, discussed the importance and impact of investing in educating girls. The event, hosted in partnership with Africa Leadership and Dialogue Institute (ALADI), convened leaders and practitioners who play an influential and impactful role in girls’ education and young women’s economic empowerment in Africa.

Young climate activists have more in common than we think – especially beyond borders. 🌎 

To fight climate change, Canada needs to turn to Indigenous communities, specifically young Indigenous leaders in Canada. 🌱

The Canadian government has been increasingly turning to Indigenous communities’ expertise to help further reconciliation. In 2021, the federal government set aside $340 million to support areas protected by Indigenous groups and networks of Indigenous experts. 💰

Where is the progress on this, according to young Indigenous leaders driving solutions to tackle Canada’s climate crisis? What else needs to be done? 📈

Meanwhile, across the world, young people in Africa are bearing the brunt of climate change-related disasters. More than 200 million young people are disproportionately affected by climate-change impacts on their health, wellbeing and future.💧 

Like Canada, Africa is a large place, home to diverse youth with unique regional needs and perspectives. Young people are increasingly becoming a resource to tackle climate change. 💪🏽

This October 23 webinar will highlight the voices of change from both continents, featuring youth-led initiatives and stories of resilience. 📣 

We will delve into challenges and systemic issues brought by colonialism and how these young leaders are leveraging their communities’ expertise, advocating for policy changes, and building cross-cultural alliances to address climate injustices. 🤝
