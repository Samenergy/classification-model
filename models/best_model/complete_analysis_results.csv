Before working with Auntie Porridge, Jackie, a grain aggregator, used to scrape by selling small sacks of rice, earning around UGX 100,000 ($26) a month.

When Angella’s company became a steady buyer, Jackie’s business transformed. She now sells one to two tons at a time, boosting her income by 600% and investing in her family’s future.

This was possible thanks to Inua Capital and the Mastercard Foundation Africa Growth Fund helping Auntie Porridge scale, linking them to formal markets and transforming lives far beyond Kampala.

Stories like Jackie’s show why investing in African businesses, led by Africans, is about more than growth. It’s about building dignity and resilience from the village up.

In a keynote speech at the Inclusive Africa Conference 2025, Dina randrianasolo, Director Strategic Partnerships & Innovation  Mastercard Foundation set the tone for urgent, actionable inclusion. She called on everyone governments, innovators, entrepreneurs, and communities to stop treating accessibility as an afterthought and start recognizing it as the foundation for progress.

From announcing 92,000+ youth with disabilities supported through Young Africa Works to spotlighting entrepreneurs like Julius Mbura and Faith, Dina reminded us that access to Assistive Technology is access to possibility.
Only 3% of the 135 million Africans who need AT have it. But when youth with disabilities are equipped, they don’t just thrive they lead, create, and shift systems.

Her call to action was clear: don’t just open doors, hold them open. Share power. Scale solutions. And build an Africa where exclusion is no longer an option.

Young climate activists have more in common than we think – especially beyond borders. 🌎 

To fight climate change, Canada needs to turn to Indigenous communities, specifically young Indigenous leaders in Canada. 🌱

The Canadian government has been increasingly turning to Indigenous communities’ expertise to help further reconciliation. In 2021, the federal government set aside $340 million to support areas protected by Indigenous groups and networks of Indigenous experts. 💰

Where is the progress on this, according to young Indigenous leaders driving solutions to tackle Canada’s climate crisis? What else needs to be done? 📈

Meanwhile, across the world, young people in Africa are bearing the brunt of climate change-related disasters. More than 200 million young people are disproportionately affected by climate-change impacts on their health, wellbeing and future.💧 

Like Canada, Africa is a large place, home to diverse youth with unique regional needs and perspectives. Young people are increasingly becoming a resource to tackle climate change. 💪🏽

This October 23 webinar will highlight the voices of change from both continents, featuring youth-led initiatives and stories of resilience. 📣 

We will delve into challenges and systemic issues brought by colonialism and how these young leaders are leveraging their communities’ expertise, advocating for policy changes, and building cross-cultural alliances to address climate injustices. 🤝
